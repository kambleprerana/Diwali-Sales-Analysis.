ðŸª” Diwali Sales Analysis

...Project Overview...

This is a "practice data analysis project" using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
I worked on a Diwali sales dataset to practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
This project analyzes "Diwali Sales Data" to uncover customer purchasing behavior and trends.  
The goal is to help businesses understand "which products, categories, and customer segments" drive higher sales during festive seasons.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- File: Diwali Sales Data.csv  
- About: Contains customer details, product categories, orders, and purchase amounts during Diwali sales.  

 ...Tools & Libraries..
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

 What I Did
 
- Cleaned the dataset (removed null values, unnecessary columns).  
- Explored sales by **gender, age group, state, occupation, marital status**.  
- Found top-performing **product categories and products**.  
- Created visualizations to understand customer buying behavior.

 Key Learnings
  
- Learned how to clean and prepare raw datasets.  
- Practiced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Improved skills in using **pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**.
